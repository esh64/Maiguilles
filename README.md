# Maiguilles
Maiguilles is an arduino oriented software in wich we are able to use an cheap 8 bit microcontroler as an osciloscope or function generator. For now it's only possible to work with digital signal. We hope that in a close future we could work with analog signal aswell. It was written in python 2.7 powered by qt4 so it could run in any operational system that suports qt4. The development already reached Linux and Windows support, trought the recent Windows updates made the windows suport temporary unavaible.

## Instalation
* Linux: Its needs all the python files in the marster Directory and also requires some other depedencies:
  * Python libs:
    * [PyQt4](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt4/)
    * [python-serial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shortintro.html)
  * [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
  * [Arduino Makefiles](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile)
 
* Windows: *Temporary unavaible.*
